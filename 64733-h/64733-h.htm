following Sermon is printed, partly because some who heard it
wished to possess it, and partly because it has been suggested to
me that it would be useful for distribution as a tract.&nbsp; It
is simply what I have called it, &ldquo;a plain Sermon,&rdquo;
written and printed for ordinary hearers and readers.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span><span
class="smcap">St. Matthew</span>, <span class="smcap">xix</span>,
3, 4, 5, 6.</h2>
<blockquote><p>The Pharisees also came unto Him, tempting Him,
and saying unto Him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife
for every cause?</p>
<p>And He answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that He
which made them at the beginning made them male and female, And
said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and
shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one
flesh?&nbsp; Wherefore they are no more twain, but one
flesh.&nbsp; What therefore <span class="smcap">God</span> hath
joined together, let not man put asunder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> priest&rsquo;s lips
should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his
mouth.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was part of the reproof which God,
through the prophet Malachi,<a name="citation3"></a><a
href="#footnote3" class="citation">[3]</a> administered to His
priests and His people, for not teaching and not learning the
divine will respecting idolatry and adultery.</p>
<p>The words may well arouse <i>us</i>, my
brethren&mdash;God&rsquo;s priests and God&rsquo;s
people&mdash;from the apathy which would neither proclaim nor
seek for the teaching of the Word of God, in the time of a great
moral and religious crisis.&nbsp; You all know, probably, to what
I allude.&nbsp; There is a bill now before the Lower House of
Parliament, having passed the Upper House, which proposes to make
it a common law of the land, that Christian marriages may, in
certain cases, be wholly dissolved, and that the divorced persons
may re-marry in the lifetimes of those from whom they have been
divorced.&nbsp; <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>Yea, and even more: the bill would give full liberty
(designedly it would seem, from the language of its advocates) to
the person whose guilt has rendered the divorce possible, to
perpetuate that guilt in company with the first partner in it,
and to dignify the union by the appellation of Holy
Matrimony.</p>
<p>Now, my brethren, I could adduce many moral reasons why we
should take alarm at the most distant prospect of such a state of
things, and set ourselves most earnestly to work, if not to
oppose it, yet at least to put it off, until we have had time to
judge of its expediency and its consequences; but I take a higher
stand, and I entreat you to do so&mdash;a religious stand.&nbsp;
The Word of God deals with the question of marriage, and
legislates upon it; God prescribes the qualifications for it, the
duties of it, the nature and endurance of its covenant, and the
prohibitions against entering upon it.</p>
<p>Are you prepared, my brethren, to say that all that is now
proposed as law of the land is in harmony with the law of
God?&nbsp; Recollect you do say so, if you do not strongly deny
it and protest against it.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that is not with me is
against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God Himself deals with this whole question.&nbsp; Have you so
investigated the subject, as to feel convinced that man only
proposes now to carry out God&rsquo;s law?&nbsp; If you were
appealed to to petition against this bill, or to pray that it may
be put off, would your refusal to do so (if you refused) be
grounded upon a thorough conviction, formed from devout and
careful study of God&rsquo;s Word, that there was nothing
religiously wrong in the measure!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; To many of you
the trumpet has <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>appeared to give an uncertain sound, and you have not
prepared yourselves for the battle.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
priest&rsquo;s lips have not kept knowledge, and you have not
sought the law at his mouth,&rdquo; or anywhere else.</p>
<p>I say not this in idle declamation against others, dear
brethren.&nbsp; I exempt not myself when I say that the vast
majority of God&rsquo;s priests and people have long remained in
strange and culpable ignorance or indifference about the teaching
of God, and the occasional human legislation on this subject; and
that it is only very gradually that they are being awakened, and
led to the knowledge of what has Divine sanction and what has
human sanction, and consequently to a correct judgment, as to
what should be done at this crisis.</p>
<p>Let us, my brethren, awake quickly and thoroughly, while there
is use in so doing.&nbsp; Let us, priests and people, betake us
to the Word of God, and speak and hear what is there written; and
then let us go forth to be doers of that Word, according to our
several abilities and opportunities.</p>
<p>Marriage, you know, was instituted in the time of man&rsquo;s
innocency.&nbsp; God judged that it was not good for man to be
alone; He therefore gave him a help meet for him.&nbsp; That help
was a creature formed, not separately and independently, but out
of himself&mdash;bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh.&nbsp;
And so close and dear was the union, divinely cemented between
them, intended to be, that Adam was taught by God to
say&mdash;and Moses to record for future
men&mdash;&ldquo;Therefore shall a man leave his father and his
mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one
flesh.&rdquo; <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a>&nbsp; Thus was <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>marriage, by Divine institution, made
the first and closest of human relationships.&nbsp; And fresh,
and higher, and holier honours were bestowed on it, when Christ
made it the glorious type of His own never-to-be-broken union
with His Church; calling Himself the bridegroom, her the bride;
giving Himself for her, and loving and cherishing her as His own
flesh; and providing that she should be presented to Him a
glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing;
that her espousals should be celebrated by angels, and that she
should be for ever with the Lord.</p>
<p>The history of the institution of marriage, and this
exaltation of it into a type of Christ&rsquo;s eternal union with
the Church (so much dwelt on in some books of the Old Testament)
would teach us clearly, that no divorce, <i>save by death</i>,
was originally contemplated in the Divine mind; and this is
further incontestibly proved by Christ in the language of the
text&mdash;&ldquo;Have ye not read, that He which made them at
the beginning&rdquo; (He, that is, who designed what they should
be and do, and has an indisputable right to exercise His will)
&ldquo;made them male and female,&rdquo; (male and female man,
this means&mdash;imperfect parts of one
being&mdash;&ldquo;<i>man</i>,&rdquo;) and joined them together,
&ldquo;and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and
mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one
flesh?&nbsp; Wherefore they are no more twain, but one
flesh.&nbsp; What therefore God hath joined together, let not man
put asunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, brethren, is <span class="smcap">Christ</span> the <span
class="smcap">Word&rsquo;s</span> answer to the question of the
Pharisees, &ldquo;Whether it is lawful for a man to put away his
wife for every cause.&rdquo;&nbsp; He refers His inquirers
immediately to the original <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>institution of marriage, as a
sufficient answer, and, quoting the words then used by the
Creator Himself, or dictated by His inspiration, expressive of
the most entire and permanent union required between a man and
his wife&mdash;words which He says make them no longer
&ldquo;twain, but one flesh&rdquo;&mdash;He adds His own
absolute, peremptory, and unqualified decree, &ldquo;What
therefore God has joined together, let not man put
asunder.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this sentence, observe He makes no
exception; He allows neither adultery nor any other cause, as a
justification of a breach of His prohibition.&nbsp; He positively
forbids every human being to dissolve a union, which, as He
shows, the Almighty designed to be indissoluble. <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<p>His words were objected to by the Pharisees, as my
interpretation of them will doubtless be by some, because in the
Old Testament&mdash;in the Law given by Moses&mdash;there were
distinct rules of divorce; not simply of putting away, but of
marrying again.&nbsp; &ldquo;They say unto Him, &lsquo;Why did
Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put
her away.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; It is to these words, contained in
the 24th chapter of Deuteronomy, vv. 1, 2, that the Pharisees
alluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When a man hath taken a wife and married
her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes,
because he hath found some uncleanness in her, then let him write
her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her
out of his house.&nbsp; And when she is departed out of his
house, she may go and be another man&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this, it must be admitted, <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>was naturally a stumbling-block to the
Pharisees, preventing the easy reception of Christ&rsquo;s
teaching.&nbsp; And yet it should have presented no permanent
difficulty to teachable minds.&nbsp; Was this, in Moses&rsquo;s
time (and since, till Christ&rsquo;s), the law of God?&nbsp; What
of that?&nbsp; God, by His prophet Jesus Christ (<i>we</i> can
say God in His own person), now repealed that law, and reverted
to His original declarations and prohibitions.&nbsp; Who, then,
shall perceive a contradiction in the forbidding of divorce,
because it had been previously allowed, when it is the same
authority which exerts itself first to allow, and then to
disallow?&nbsp; Who shall venture to say it is lawful for
<i>man</i> to act now upon a law long since repealed by
<i>God</i>, and replaced by a directly contrary one?&nbsp;
<i>But</i>, <i>brethren</i>, <i>this never was God&rsquo;s
law</i>.&nbsp; Hear what Christ says&mdash;&ldquo;Moses, because
of the hardness of your hearts, <i>suffered</i> you to put away
your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Moses, the civil magistrate, finding it impossible to restrain
the obstinate and rebellious Israelites within the bounds
originally set for them by God, attempted to regulate, in some
measure, their lawless ways, and to secure some regard for public
and private rights.&nbsp; Accordingly, as they had fallen into
the practice of dismissing their wives for many frivolous
reasons, and often in momentary displeasure, of which they
afterwards relented, and sought them again, Moses required that
<i>when</i> they did so dismiss their wives, they should do it
deliberately, and in a formal way, writing a bill of divorcement;
and with the understanding, probably as a check upon
precipitancy, that no after repentance should render them able to
claim their wives again, if they had availed <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>themselves of
their supposed liberty, and taken other husbands.&nbsp; So much
of sanction and regulation of unlawful courses did Moses
condescend to.</p>
<p>But it may be objected: &ldquo;Moses was God&rsquo;s deputy,
what he sanctioned God therefore must have approved.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, truly, we do not suppose that Moses acted without Divine
permission; <i>but such permission did not amount to
approval</i>.&nbsp; Suppose you that God approved of the
ignorance of the heathen, because we are told He &ldquo;winked at
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Was wicked Balaam&rsquo;s forbidden journey
approved by God, because He directed what should be said and done
on it?&nbsp; Was the lawless divorce between the king Jehovah and
His kingdom Israel, and the re-marriage of that kingdom with an
earthly king, divinely approved, because regulations for the
management of that adulterous kingdom were vouchsafed by
God?&nbsp; No, brethren; God simply made the best of the
evil.&nbsp; He set bounds to it, and so diminished it; in a
measure condescending to human infirmities, and effecting through
them His good and wise purposes.&nbsp; Thus He has ever done and
still does: but not in the case of separation of man and wife for
re-marriage; all sanction, all toleration of this breach of His
commandment He has withdrawn for ever.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say unto
you&rdquo; (they are Christ&rsquo;s words) &ldquo;whosoever shall
put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry
another, committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put
away, doth commit adultery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here it is objected: &ldquo;This is granting the whole
matter in dispute&mdash;&lsquo;Except it be for
fornication.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is all that is proposed to the
Legislature now: the putting away of an unfaithful wife, and (the
vows between them being thus loosed) the <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>removal of
obstacles to a fresh marriage or marriages.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, I
confess, brethren, that the full explanation of this apparent
exception is what I cannot offer within the space of time allowed
me this morning.&nbsp; Neither can it be given at all to those
who will not bestow on it close and somewhat learned
attention.&nbsp; I am satisfied in my own mind (and I believe I
could satisfy any one who will study the passage with me), that
this is no real exception to the general prohibition.&nbsp; But I
can show you all, in few words, how little its ordinary
interpretation is to be relied on.&nbsp; It is mentioned twice,
<a name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a> once in the hearing of the multitude,
once to the Pharisees.&nbsp; It is found only in the Gospel of
St. Matthew, written for Jewish converts.&nbsp; It does not occur
in the Gospel of St. Mark, or in that of St. Luke, written for
the Gentiles, in both of which the prohibition of putting away is
absolute and without exception, and it is never once alluded to
in any other part of the New Testament.&nbsp; Not even in the
Epistles to the Corinthians, among whom the sin in question was a
very common one, and to whom St. Paul gives full directions about
the married state, is there the remotest hint of such a
separation being lawful, <i>though the verse of the Gospel in
which it occurs is actually referred to in the seventh chapter of
the</i> 1<i>st</i> <i>Epistle</i>, (vv. 10, 11).&nbsp; &ldquo;And
unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord
(&lsquo;Matthew xix, 6, 9,&rsquo; says the marginal reference),
Let not the wife depart from her husband: but if she depart, let
her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband; and let
not the husband put away his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Now,
when we remember that all Holy Scripture was dictated by the same
Spirit; that that Spirit brought to the remembrance of the Sacred
Writers, or taught them all that Christ did and said, and
suggested to them all that they should write; that all the sacred
writings were not <i>at once</i> put into the hands of each
Christian disciple, but that in most cases probably only a single
gospel and an epistle or two were to be found in any one church,
what inference are we compelled to draw from this exception being
mentioned only in the Gospel written <i>first</i>, and written
for <i>Jews</i>; but that it was a parenthetical recognition of
the Jewish criminal law, which put the adulterer and adulteress
to death?&nbsp; As though Christ had begun to declare His decree,
that marriage should in no case be dissolved, and then stopped
short to announce in a parenthesis, that He meant not, at least
in <i>their</i> case, at <i>that</i> time, to interfere with the
husband&rsquo;s right to deliver up a faithless wife to the
officers of justice, to be dealt with by the law.&nbsp; The
Gentiles had no such law delivered them from God: they were
receiving Divine law for the first time: in writing for them,
therefore, there was no need of such an allusion to the Mosaic
law, and accordingly the Spirit left it out, though it had been
spoken by Christ.</p>
<p>But, however this may be, even if there is an exception in the
case of such sin, to the general law against putting away,
<i>there is no exception whatever to the general law against
re-marriage in each other&rsquo;s lifetime</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whosoever shall put away his wife&rdquo; (&ldquo;except it
be for fornication,&rdquo; belongs only to these words, most
clearly not to those that follow), &ldquo;and shall marry
another, committeth adultery; and <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>whoso marrieth her which is put
away&rdquo; (this means in the original Greek <i>any</i> divorced
woman) &ldquo;doth commit adultery.&rdquo;&nbsp; You get the full
force of this whole prohibition, if you bear in mind that our
Lord is answering the Pharisees&rsquo; reference to the
permission given by Moses in the first and second verses of the
24th chapter of Deuteronomy, and showing what was to be observed
in future.&nbsp; With reference to the first verse, which
recognises putting away in certain cases, Christ says,
&ldquo;Whoso putteth away his wife (except it be for
fornication), and marrieth another, committeth
adultery.&rdquo;&nbsp; In answer to the second verse, in which
Moses permits, &ldquo;When she is departed out of his house, she
may go and be another man&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; Christ says,
&ldquo;<i>Whosoever marrieth any divorced woman</i>,
<i>committeth adultery</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, then, is the sum
of the matter:&mdash;<i>Perhaps</i> Christ permits a man so to
put away a faithless wife, as no longer to have his home and
children contaminated by her presence, or to be responsible for
her maintenance and recognition as his wife: but He does not
allow him to take another wife in her lifetime; and if any one
marries her, He counts him an adulterer, a sinner of that odious
class which God, when He ruled temporally, commanded to be stoned
to death, and whom He still condemns to spiritual and eternal
death, saying through His apostle, that they &ldquo;shall not
inherit the kingdom of God.&rdquo; <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a></p>
<p>In the face of all this, and I have urged but a tithe of what
might be said, can a Christian State provide for the divorce of
Christians, and their re-marriage with others, during the lives
of their only <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>lawful husbands or wives?&nbsp; I say most confidently,
No!&nbsp; In my Master&rsquo;s name I protest most loudly against
such dishonour to His commands, and entreat you protest with
me.&nbsp; But suppose the State insists upon her civil power,
alleging the rule of expediency, which is so lamentably urged in
these days, and maintaining that we cannot legislate now
according to the law of God.&nbsp; Suppose she legalises such
divorces and reunions.&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Why, let her take
the responsibility wholly on herself: let her treat them as
<i>civil</i> contracts, and not require the Church to join in
such spiritual adultery against Christ.&nbsp; I crave your
earnest attention and warm sympathy, dearly beloved, in the
terrible alternative which threatens us, the ministers of
Christ.&nbsp; If this bill passes, without a proviso, that the
Church shall not be called on to celebrate or sanction such
unions, then we must either wholly renounce our allegiance to
Christ in this behalf, or brave the law of the land by becoming
rebels against it, in not marrying adulterers and adulteresses,
and not admitting them to Holy Communion.</p>
<p>A politician of the nineteenth century may urge (and be
applauded for it), that you cannot legislate now by the
Decalogue.&nbsp; &ldquo;You cannot put down atheism,&rdquo; he
may tell you, &ldquo;or idolatry, or blasphemy, or Sabbath
desecration.&rdquo;&nbsp; That may be, though the admission is a
fearful one.&nbsp; But you do not call upon the officers of
religion to take part in those sins.&nbsp; Now, if you make me
marry adulterers, or administer to them the blessed Body and
Blood of Christ, it is all the same thing as if you compelled me
to preach atheism from this pulpit, or to worship an idol before
God&rsquo;s altar, or to blaspheme His holy name in His
sanctuary, or set the example <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of Sabbath desecration.&nbsp; Look at
the Church&rsquo;s service for Holy Matrimony.&nbsp; It requires
the respective parties to say before God, that there is no
disqualification in His sight to their union.&nbsp; It pledges
them to take each other <i>for better or worse</i>, <i>till death
parts them</i>.&nbsp; It unites them with the solemn words,
&ldquo;Those whom God hath joined together, let no man put
asunder.&rdquo;&nbsp; It makes the priest say to God, that it
shall never be lawful to put asunder those whom He by matrimony
has made one, and it requires him to pronounce, as by God&rsquo;s
authority and in God&rsquo;s name, two solemn benedictions on the
union of those before him.&nbsp; Is not this an awful profanation
if used in the case of adulterers?&nbsp; Is it not, in the
memorable language of the Archbishop of Canterbury, <a
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a> &ldquo;beyond the power of charity
itself to hope for God&rsquo;s blessing on an union which had its
origin in a guilty passion, and was only rendered possible by the
commission of a heinous crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few words in answer to the objection: &ldquo;Has not the
state of things you deprecate, been already lawful for some three
hundred years?&nbsp; Is not the only change proposed now, the
substitution of a judicial court to try the case and pronounce
sentence, for the direct legislation of the Houses of
Parliament?&rdquo;&nbsp; Brethren, there is as yet no common law
of this land which allows divorce and re-marriage.&nbsp; There is
indeed an imitation now and then of one of the great corruptions
of Popery.&nbsp; The Church of Rome pronounces marriage
absolutely indissoluble, and utters a loud anathema against any
one who presumes to say that it may <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>ever be dissolved.&nbsp; But if she
is well paid for it, she will readily grant the Pope&rsquo;s
dispensation (at least she has often done this to those whom she
has a mind to favour), and allow of their divorce and
re-marriage.&nbsp; A relic of this Popery, I say, exists among
us.&nbsp; The law of Holy Scripture, echoed by the Church, is
generally recognized by the State, who therefore has no statute
on her books permitting divorce and re-marriage; but if any one
will go to the expense and prove his case, she will grant a
special dispensation, passing a &ldquo;private act,&rdquo; which
nullifies, in that individual case, the law of the land.&nbsp;
The toleration of this kind of legislation for more than three
hundred years, is a shameful reproach to those who brought it
about, and to those who do not seek to alter it; but it is no
precedent for a general dispensation with the law: unless it be a
good plea for continuing in sin, and plunging deeper into it,
that we have already sinned, and more than once.&nbsp; Neither is
the effect of such a private act anything like so great or so
injurious as a general law would be.&nbsp; Whoever has heard of
these special dispensations, either in righteous indignation, or
in jealousy because he is not rich enough to secure a like
privilege, has cried &ldquo;shame&rdquo; on them.&nbsp; But let
the State utter with her whole strength of voice, <i>and to
all</i>, that the marriage bond can be easily cancelled, and
fresh unions formed; let her add this sanction, this favouring of
adulterers to the encouragement they already derive, from knowing
that the State does not regard their sin as a crime, though God
calls it a deadly one, and&mdash;not at once; probably English
decency will long delay it, but surely ultimately&mdash;the Word
of God will be made of none effect; <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>married life will lose all its
privileges, and safeguards, and charms; morality will be
outraged; evil called good, and good evil.&nbsp; This view, my
brethren, is illustrated by the effect of a similar licence in
Prussia: and it is awfully corroborated by the past Providence of
God, Who has ever smitten with judicial blindness, those who
would not see, and has left them to grope in foul darkness, and
to fall into destruction.</p>
<p>My dear brethren, I trust that none of you will think that I
have taken up your time unprofitably this morning.&nbsp; With so
few opportunities of speaking to you of our common salvation, and
urging you to lay hold of it, we should be very blameable if we
misused any of them.&nbsp; But the glory of God in Christ in the
assertion of His holy law; the vindication of His Church; the
preservation of His ministers from unworthy temporizing, or from
conflict with the secular powers; the welfare of the State, and
the defence of our dear English domestic life from the heaviest
blow that ever threatened it, and the foulest blot that ever
assayed to stain it, is surely a Christian minister&rsquo;s most
legitimate use of his time and opportunity; and I, for one, most
strongly feel, that I should have been fearfully guilty had I not
so employed it; and that my position would have been an
unaccountable one, if I had been now silent, and yet, if this
bill becomes law, had ventured to say (as may God give me grace
to do!) &ldquo;Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken
unto you more than unto God, judge ye.&nbsp; For we cannot but
speak (and do) the things which we have heard and
seen.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
